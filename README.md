# newWonderOfTheWorld
looking in to creating creation mythology

I just saw an image I was very inspired by.  It depicted a large mamoth like, elephantine sphinx statue.  It was an AI generated image.  It was meant to capture the feeling of what it would look like to discover a "new wonder of the world".

That sounds like a very interesting and inspiring image! AI-generated images have become increasingly popular and sophisticated in recent years, allowing us to explore new creative possibilities and imagine things that might not be possible otherwise. The image you described seems to capture the sense of awe and wonder that comes with discovering something new and incredible.

The idea of a new wonder of the world is certainly intriguing. Throughout history, humans have been fascinated by remarkable structures and monuments that showcase human achievement and ingenuity. From the pyramids of Egypt to the Great Wall of China to the Taj Mahal, these wonders have captured our imaginations and inspired us to dream big and push the boundaries of what we can accomplish.

It's exciting to think about what a new wonder of the world might look like in our modern age, with all the technology and resources we have at our disposal. Perhaps it would be something massive and awe-inspiring like the sphinx statue you saw in the image, or maybe it would be something more subtle and intricate. Whatever it is, the idea of discovering something truly remarkable and awe-inspiring is something that can inspire us all to keep pushing forward and reaching for new heights.
